## Phase 1

- The project uses react with [Tailwind](www.tailwindcss.com) and [DaisyUI](daisyui.com) for styling.
- The route for login/signup is `/auth` and the route for profile is `/me`. All other routes display the 404 page.
- The `src` folder contains the source code. The `assets` folder contains the images used.
- In components, there are separate folders for the authentication page and the profile page.
- There is also a file for the navbar, the 404 page and the middleware for checking if a user is authenticated or unauthenticated.
- All routes are in `index.js` and `App.js` is unused.
- The `AuthPage` folder contains the main `Authorize.jsx` file which conditionally renders either `Login.jsx` or `Signup.jsx` based on which mode has been selected in the tab switcher provided in `Authorize.jsx`. The corresponding handler functions are in the login and signup files. Username and password have both been hardcoded to admin. 
- On successful login, an item is stored in local storage to denote that the user is logged in. If a user who is not logged in attempts to navigate to `/me`, they will immediately be redirected to the login page. Similarly, if a logged in user attempts to visit the login page, they will be automatically redirected to the profile page.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
